# Web-Design-Challenge
This is a website that was created to share my Cancer Case Study Project Analysis from a previous repository. It contains the plots that were created from that data set as well as an explaination of what each plot represents. The main elements of the website use Bootstrap and its responsive functionality for small and extra small screen sizes.
